# Building a Secure Communication System with Real-World Cryptographic Techniques
## 1. Introduction
The objective of this project is to design and implement a secure communication system that ensures confidentiality, integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation. The system leverages a combination of symmetric and asymmetric cryptographic techniques to protect sensitive data during transmission. Additionally, machine learning-based anomaly detection is integrated to monitor communication patterns and detect potential security breaches, further strengthening the system’s ability to prevent unauthorized access or tampering.

## 2. Cryptographic Design Choices
### 2.1. Symmetric Encryption: AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)
Reason for Choice:

AES is one of the most widely used and trusted symmetric encryption algorithms due to its efficiency and strength. It is highly resistant to brute-force attacks, especially with key sizes of 128, 192, or 256 bits.
For this project, AES-256 was chosen to encrypt message content, ensuring strong encryption for the communication system.
Security Guarantees:

Confidentiality: AES ensures that the data is unreadable to anyone except those with the decryption key.
Performance: AES is fast and efficient, which is critical for real-time communication.
### 2.2. Asymmetric Encryption: RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman)
Reason for Choice:

RSA is a widely adopted asymmetric encryption algorithm that supports key exchange, digital signatures, and data encryption.
RSA was selected for public-key cryptography to facilitate secure key exchange and digital signature verification.
Security Guarantees:

Key Exchange: RSA enables secure key exchange by encrypting a shared secret with the recipient’s public key, ensuring that only the intended recipient can decrypt it using their private key.
Digital Signatures: RSA is used for signing messages, ensuring the sender's authenticity and the integrity of the message.
### 2.3. Hashing: SHA-256 (Secure Hash Algorithm)
Reason for Choice:

SHA-256 is used to generate message digests in the process of signing messages. It provides a fixed-size hash that uniquely represents the message content.
Security Guarantees:

Message Integrity: Any change in the message would lead to a different hash, allowing detection of tampering.
### 2.4. Cryptographic Protocols Used
RSA for Key Exchange and Digital Signatures: RSA is utilized to exchange public keys securely and to sign messages, providing authentication and integrity.
AES for Data Encryption: AES-256 is used to encrypt the message content during transmission.
Padding (PKCS7) for AES Encryption: Padding is used to ensure that the plaintext is a multiple of the block size, which is a requirement for block ciphers in CBC mode.
## 3. System Architecture
The secure communication system consists of the following components:

Key Generation and Exchange: RSA public and private keys are generated. The sender encrypts the AES key with the recipient's public key, ensuring secure key exchange.
Message Encryption and Decryption:
The sender encrypts the message using AES.
The message is then sent along with the AES key (encrypted using the recipient’s public RSA key).
The recipient decrypts the AES key using their RSA private key and decrypts the message content with the AES key.
Digital Signatures:
The sender signs the message using their RSA private key to ensure authenticity.
The recipient verifies the signature using the sender’s public key to confirm that the message was not altered.
## 4. Security Guarantees Provided
The system offers the following security guarantees:

Confidentiality: Using AES encryption, the message remains unreadable to unauthorized parties.
Integrity: Digital signatures (RSA) and hashing (SHA-256) ensure that the message has not been tampered with during transmission.
Authentication: Digital signatures confirm the identity of the sender, preventing impersonation.
Non-repudiation: The sender cannot deny sending a message once it is signed with their private key.
## 5. AI/ML-Based Threat Detection
In addition to traditional cryptographic measures, we integrated machine learning (ML)-based anomaly detection to monitor communication patterns and detect potential security breaches. By analyzing metadata such as message size, transmission time, and frequency, we can identify deviations from normal behavior that might indicate a security threat.

### 5.1. Data Collection
Communication metadata, such as the following, is collected for training the anomaly detection model:

Message Size: The length of the encrypted message.
Transmission Time: The time taken for a message to travel from the sender to the receiver.
Frequency: The frequency at which messages are sent.
### 5.2. Machine Learning Model: Autoencoders
To detect anomalies in communication patterns, we used an Autoencoder, an unsupervised machine learning model. An autoencoder is trained to learn the normal communication behavior and flag anomalies when the reconstruction error exceeds a certain threshold.
### 5.3. Explanation of the ML Code
Data Simulation: We simulated normal and anomalous communication data to train and test the anomaly detection model.
Autoencoder Architecture: The model is built with an encoder-decoder structure, designed to learn the normal data and detect anomalies when reconstruction error is large.
Anomaly Detection: The reconstruction error (MSE) is calculated, and any data with an error greater than a defined threshold is flagged as anomalous.
Performance Evaluation: The performance of the anomaly detection model is evaluated using a classification report, and the distribution of reconstruction errors is visualized.
### 5.4. Enhancements for Real-Time Monitoring
Real-Time Data Collection: In a real-world implementation, metadata such as message size, frequency, and transmission time would be continuously collected.
Alerting System: The system can trigger alerts whenever an anomaly is detected, helping to prevent potential security breaches.
## 6. Potential Vulnerabilities and Improvements
### 6.1. Quantum Computing Threat
Vulnerability: Current cryptographic systems like RSA and AES could be vulnerable to quantum attacks. Shor's algorithm could break RSA and ECC encryption, and Grover's algorithm could reduce the security of symmetric encryption like AES.
Improvement: Transitioning to post-quantum cryptography (PQC) is a potential solution. Algorithms such as Lattice-based Cryptography (e.g., NTRU or Kyber) could provide resistance to quantum attacks.
### 6.2. Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks
Vulnerability: Without a trusted mechanism to authenticate public keys, an attacker could intercept and alter the keys during key exchange.
Improvement: Incorporating a public key infrastructure (PKI) with trusted Certificate Authorities (CAs) can mitigate MITM attacks by verifying public key authenticity.
### 6.3. Secure Key Management
Vulnerability: If private keys are not securely stored or managed, they could be compromised, allowing an attacker to impersonate the user.
Improvement: Using Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) or secure key vaults can ensure that private keys are securely stored and not exposed during communication.
### 6.4. Side-Channel Attacks
Vulnerability: Cryptographic algorithms, especially RSA and AES, are susceptible to side-channel attacks (e.g., timing attacks).
Improvement: Implementing constant-time algorithms and using cryptographic libraries that are resistant to side-channel attacks can reduce this vulnerability.
